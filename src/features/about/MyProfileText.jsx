        <strong>Hello World!</strong> I&apos;m Ilyana, a passionate junior
        frontend developer based in Selangor, MY. My journey began with a
        curiosity for coding and has grown into a love for building seamless,
        interactive digital experiences.

        I love to learn new things about programming and have experiences with
        frameworks like Angular and React. I&apos;m dedicated to learning and
        expanding my skills, and I thrive in collaborative environments where I
        can bring creative ideas to life.

        I&apos;m currently upskilling myself to be a fullstack developer and
        learning Node.js. When I&apos;m not coding, I like to travel, watching
        movies and playing games. Looking forward to contributing to meaningful
        projects and bringing fresh ideas to the table!
